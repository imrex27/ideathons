           <li>Corrupt Police force / SWAT / Mayor is not allowed.</li>

           <li>Do not break the NLR (New Life Rule) (This means you "forget" everything what happened after you die and you have to play as a new person (you can't revenge your death etc.). It's also forbidden to return to the place where you died for 3 minutes).</li>
           <li>The spawn is a Safe Zone, that means you cannot arrest, kill, rob, do hits, mug or kidnap in it.</li>

        <p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>General DarkRP Rules:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
           <li>Do not FailRP. This is the act of failing to role play a job properly within the scope of the rules. If you are in a specific job requiring you to carry out specific duties and you are failing to carry out those duties, you will be demoted.</li>
           <li>Do not Random Demote. This is when you demote someone without good reason. You only need to
               demote when a staff member is not available to help you and when a person has violated the rules in any way.</li>
           <li>Do not Job Abuse. This is the act of abusing a job for personal gain and avoiding your responsibility to RP as the job title you have selected (for example switching to gun dealer to buy yourself weapons then switching back to gangster, etc.)</li>
           <li>Do not scam anyone (pretend to sell items or services, then take the money without providing those items or services).</li>
           <li>Do not META Game (This means you cannot RP in /ooc (out of character) chat or benefit from the information you can acquire there).</li>
           <li>You must have a proper RP reason to place a hit (for example the person who you place a hit on has attempted to kill you).</li>
           <li>Do not spawn and use printers as a bomb or method of destroying and killing.</li>
           <li>You are not allowed to pocket printers.</li>
           <li>You can't put props/cameras/entities in other people's bases without their consent.</li>
           <li>Gangsters and Thieves can only mug once per 5 minutes and only for a maximum of 2.500$. It's not RDM if a victim who refuses to pay gets shot.</li>
